# UFOs

## Overview
This project was to gather and display UFO sighting information in a dynamic webpage.

## Results
To use this webpage for understanding UFO sightings, someone could filter on one value to narrow the search results. Based on what the search results return, the user could filter on a second value to narrow their search further. For example, first the user could filter by their home state, MN. Then, the user could peruse the data and find another filter to explore such as shape.

## Summary
One drawback of this new design is that the user doesn't necessarily know what values are available when filtering. This issue could be improved by serving up a dropdown list of values for each search filter. Another improvement would be to allow sorting so that the user could filter the information and then sort it for a quick look at information.
